# node_api

This is my first javascript node back-end project. I have used npm libraries like bcryptjs(hashing passwords), joi(input validations), jsonwebtoken(authentication & authorisation), expressjs, mongoose(mongodb driver), dotenv(store environment variables).
I'll be adding more features to the project as I learn and grow.
I'm open for collaboration.
